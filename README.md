# Cooking After Midnight
Cooking After Midnight is a recipes website with a metal theme. I created it as my personal project to apply my HTML, Bootstrap and CSS skills, which I learned through Codecademy and Code First Girls courses. I designed the website myself and chose the colour sceme using https://coolors.co/.

I created this website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as Bootstrap. I first used Bootstrap to create the basic frame of each page, as well as the navigation bar. Most of the CSS styling was then overriden by my own styling.

In the recipes page I used JavaScript to create tabs for the ingredients and method sections. Although the tabs buttons work, the code still requires adjustments, so that when the user clicks on a "method" or "ingredients" button, only the child node of that button (i.e. the corresponding ingredients or method tab) opens and not all of them.

This website is a work in progress and, as I am developing my programming skills, I will be making improvements to make the code more efficient and elegant, as well as adding new features.
